# Bootstrap on Rails: two lines of code to style the whole app

Applying bootstrap styles to an existing Rails app can take days of work and be super cumbersome... **or as easy as 2 lines of SASS.**

![Rails bare-scaffold view styled with SASS](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5458658/25913550/870f9b78-3591-11e7-8a4d-edaa2dd6c03b.png)

The image above shows a bare view as generated by Rails scaffold. I didn't touch its HTML. It's responsive and styled via SASS -- after all, that's what stylesheets are for. Of course it could use some additional layout and design, but the cumbersome work of editing HTML everywhere doesn't need to be done anymore.


# Setup

Open the project's directory in you terminal and run:

```
bin/setup
rails server
```

The database will be filled with sample data.


# What this is about

One time I was assigned the task of applying bootstrap to an existing Rails app. I went the hard way and started applying bootstrap classes manually element-by-element, file-by-file. But I knew no other way then.

Days later, when I was almost finished, I felt so stupid when I learned that I could have done most of the work in just a few lines of SCSS/SASS.

[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) is a CSS pre-processor and Rails includes it by default when generating a new project (sass-rails gem) so it's easy to get started.


# How to do it

First, you'll need to have some views to work on and install `bootstrap-sass` gem.

Create `app/assets/stylesheets/my_bootstrap.sass` and import it in `application.scss`:

```
@import "bootstrap-sprockets";
@import "bootstrap";
@import "my_bootstrap"; // right here AFTER importing bootstrap
```

Open `my_bootstrap.sass`. To start, apply `.table`, `.table-hover` and `.table-striped` to all tables in the whole app:

```
table
  @extend .table, .table-hover, .table-striped
```

`@extend` is SASS mixin/inheritance. It takes all styles defined in the extended classes and put them under `table {...}` in the final CSS. As you see, it's possible to apply multiple mixins.

**You just styled all the tables in your app with 2 lines of SASS. How awesome is that?**


# Now a Rails-specific tip!

The previous tip applies to any HTML project using SASS. But this is a Rails project so here's a tip.

Rails appends the attribute `data-method="delete"` to links using the HTTP DELETE method. You can take advantage of that to paint red all buttons that have this attribute:

```
ERB:
<%= link_to 'Destroy', product, method: :delete %>

Generated HTML:
<a data-method="delete" href="/products/25">Destroy</a>

SASS:
a[data-method=delete]
  @extend .btn-danger
```

Rails scaffolded views have a specific structure that you can rely on to style your app globally. Check [`app/assets/stylesheets/my_bootstrap.sass`](https://github.com/jmosouza/bootstrap_on_rails/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/my_bootstrap.sass) for more ideas.
